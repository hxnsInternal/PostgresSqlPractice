/*Description: Here I created 2 tables with the same structure of the files, this tables has fields as text type, for integrity of the data.
 * After that I imported the data  Using "Dbeaver" as IDE (you can use any other client SQL tool or ETL tool to import the data) 
 * from 2 CSV files exported from the XLSX File "Shopee_FBA_case_v2.xlsx",
 * the first one was "01 - Input_products.csv" and the other one was "02 - Input_orders.csv" (this files are attached on the solution files)
